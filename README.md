# Term-Project-SPSU-CS3693-Fall2014
For historical reference. Not production ready by any means.


Majority of code by Clinton Flowers, some code by James Tuxbury, with support from Adam Liebert.

Written (Clinton's) sophomore year, Fall 2014 for Applications Programming - CS 3693. 

This is my first real C# program, and probably my second non-super-simple program, for what that implies. 

Uploading to Github for history/reference; good code not guaranteed; some bad code guaranteed. 

Comments may or may not reflect reality.
